  <section>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Calculator XXL</strong> (“the App”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) handles information when you use the App.
      We aim to keep the App simple and accessible. The App itself does not require you to create an account or enter personal details.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>1) What We Collect</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect personal information directly from you.</p>
    <p>However, because the App displays ads, our advertising partner may collect certain data automatically to serve and measure ads:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Advertising data</strong>: ad impressions, clicks, performance metrics;</li>
      <li><strong>Device and usage data</strong>: device model, OS version, language, network information, coarse location (approximate), IP address;</li>
      <li><strong>Identifiers</strong>: Google Advertising ID (AAID) or similar identifiers used for advertising and analytics.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>To display, optimize, and measure in-app advertising;</li>
      <li>To keep the App reliable and prevent fraud/abuse;</li>

    </ul>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4) Legal Bases (EEA/UK users)</h2>
