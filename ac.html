    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 03, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use the <strong>AC Remote</strong> mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Our <strong>AC Remote</strong> application is designed to function primarily as a hardware controller (via Infrared or Wi-Fi). We prioritize user privacy and minimize data collection:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect basic technical information such as your device model and OS version to optimize IR signal performance and app stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Infrared (IR) Permissions:</strong> The app requires access to your device's IR blaster to send commands to your air conditioning unit.</li>
        <li><strong>Network/Wi-Fi Permissions:</strong> Required only if your AC unit is controlled via a local network. We do not track your browsing history or external network traffic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>To keep the application free, we may use third-party services that collect information used to identify you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> Used for technical operations and app stability on Android.</li>
        <li><strong>AdMob / Third-Party Ads:</strong> Used to display advertisements. These providers may use cookies or device identifiers to show ads based on your interests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Cookies</h2>
    <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. This app does not use "cookies" directly, but third-party ad providers may use them to enhance ad targeting.</p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust in providing us with your information. We strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>These services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If we discover that a child has provided us with personal data, we immediately delete this from our servers.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at:</p>
