  </p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how this application (the “App”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use it.
    If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not use the App.
  </p>

  <h2>1. What the App does</h2>
  <p>
    The App provides a directory of publicly available television streams and links, and it may open official websites
    or third-party streaming pages so you can watch live content.
    The App does <strong>not</strong> host, upload, or retransmit TV channels on its own servers.
    All trademarks, logos, and stream rights belong to their respective owners.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Information you provide</h3>
  <p>
    The App does not require you to create an account. If you contact us by email, we will receive the information you
    include in your message (such as your email address and the content of your request).
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 Information collected automatically</h3>
  <p>
    When you use the App, some information may be collected automatically for basic operation, diagnostics, and
    performance, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device information (device model, operating system version, language, time zone).</li>
    <li>App usage data (screens viewed, taps, basic interaction events).</li>
    <li>Log data (IP address, crash reports, timestamps, and error diagnostics).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This information is used to improve stability, troubleshoot issues, and understand how the App is used.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Advertising and analytics (third-party services)</h2>
  <p>
    The App <em>may</em> display advertising and/or use analytics services, depending on how it is configured in the
    published build. If enabled, these third parties may collect information from your device to provide ads,
    measure performance, prevent fraud, or generate aggregated analytics. This can include identifiers such as
    an advertising ID (where applicable), approximate location inferred from IP address, and usage data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Common examples of third-party services used by many Android apps include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Play Services</li>
    <li>Google AdMob (for ads, if enabled)</li>
    <li>Google Analytics for Firebase (for analytics, if enabled)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you want this Policy to exactly match your app, remove any items above that you do not use.
    Third parties process data under their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Links to external websites and content</h2>
  <p>
    The App includes links to third-party websites and streaming providers. When you open a channel, you may be taken
    to an external page (either inside an in-app browser/WebView or in your device browser). Those websites may collect
    data according to their own privacy policies. We do not control and are not responsible for third-party practices.
  </p>

  <h2>5. How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and operate the App (e.g., open channel pages, remember basic preferences).</li>
    <li>To monitor performance, fix bugs, and prevent abuse or fraud.</li>
    <li>To respond to your requests if you contact us.</li>
    <li>If ads/analytics are enabled, to measure usage and improve the App and advertising relevance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Sharing of information</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal information. We may share limited information only in these cases:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers</strong>: with third-party providers that help operate the App (e.g., crash reporting, analytics, ads), if enabled.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal requirements</strong>: if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security.</li>
    <li><strong>Business changes</strong>: if the App is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain information only as long as needed for the purposes described above. Emails you send us may be kept for
    as long as necessary to handle your request, comply with legal obligations, or resolve disputes.
    Data processed by third-party services (ads/analytics) is retained according to their policies.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable measures to protect information, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
    You use the App at your own risk.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Your choices and rights</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your location (for example, the European Economic Area), you may have rights to access, correct, or
    delete certain personal data. To exercise these rights, contact us at
    <a href="mailto:smartinezantequera@gmail.com">smartinezantequera@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can often control personalized ads from your device settings (for example, resetting or limiting the advertising
    ID where your platform provides that option).
  </p>

  <h2>10. Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required by your country) without parental
    supervision. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided
    personal information, contact us and we will take steps to delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version in the App or on the listing/page
    where this Policy is published. The “Effective date” above indicates when it was last updated.
  </p>
