    <h1>Privacy Policy — USA Live TV</h1>

    <p>
      USA Live TV (“the App”, “we”, “us”) respects your privacy. This policy explains, in plain language, what information the App does and does not handle and how you can contact us.
    </p>

    <h2>What we do <em>not</em> collect</h2>
    <ul class="card">
      <li>No account is required. We do not ask you to sign up or log in.</li>
      <li>We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other personal identifiers from you within the App.</li>
      <li>We do not track your precise location.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information the App may handle</h2>
    <p>
      To make the App work correctly and improve stability, the App may process non-personal, technical data generated by your device (for example, basic device information, operating system version, general app usage events, and crash logs). This information, when present, is used only for app functionality, troubleshooting, and quality improvements and is not used to identify you personally.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-party content and links</h2>
    <p>
      The App can show or link to live streams and websites operated by third parties. When you open or play third-party content, those providers may collect information under their own privacy policies. We do not control and are not responsible for third-party practices. Please review the privacy policy of any service you visit from the App.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising and analytics</h2>
    <p>
      If advertising or analytics services are integrated, they may receive limited technical information needed to serve ads or measure performance. Any such services operate under their own privacy policies. We aim to share the minimum data necessary for the features to work.
    </p>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      Technical logs and diagnostics, when present, are kept only as long as needed for the purposes described above and then deleted or anonymized.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is intended for a general audience and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, contact us and we will take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information processed by the App. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>Your choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can control device-level permissions (e.g., network access) in your system settings.</li>
      <li>You may uninstall the App at any time to stop any further data processing by the App on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect improvements or legal requirements. Material changes will be reflected in this page.
    </p>
