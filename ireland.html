  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 14 October 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Ireland Live TV</strong> (“the App”, “we”, “our”, “us”) handles information when you use the App.</p>

  <h2>1) Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> require you to create an account.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect personally identifiable information (PII) unless you voluntarily contact us.</li>
    <li>The App opens and embeds third-party TV streams and websites. Those third parties may process data under their own policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Information We Process</h2>
  <h3>a) Information you provide</h3>
  <p>If you contact us by email, we will receive your message and address to respond to your request.</p>

  <h3>b) Information collected automatically</h3>
  <p>The App makes standard network requests to play streams and open broadcaster pages. Our App itself does not store or profile you. Your device and OS (e.g., Android/iOS) may create basic technical logs for reliability and security.</p>

  <!-- If you add analytics or crash reporting, replace this block accordingly -->
  <p><em>Note:</em> If we introduce analytics, crash reporting, or advertising SDKs, we will update this Policy and provide in-app disclosures and controls.</p>

  <h2>3) Third-Party Content & Links</h2>
  <p>The App may open or embed content from third-party broadcasters (e.g., their official sites or players). Your use of those services is governed by their own terms and privacy policies. Please review them before using those services.</p>

  <h2>4) Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child provided us personal information, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>

  <h2>5) Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain emails you send us only for as long as necessary to handle your request and to comply with legal obligations.</p>

  <h2>6) Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>7) International Users</h2>
  <p>Your communications with us may be processed in the European Economic Area (EEA) and/or other countries. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards for international transfers.</p>

  <h2>8) Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location (e.g., EEA/UK), you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your personal data and to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. To exercise these rights, contact us at the email below.</p>

  <h2>9) Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post the new effective date above and, where required, notify you in the App.</p>

  <h2>10) Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or requests about this Policy or our privacy practices, contact us at:<br>

  <hr>
  <p><small>For transparency: current build collects no PII and uses no analytics/ads SDKs. If that changes, this document will be revised and appropriate consent mechanisms will be added.</small></p>
