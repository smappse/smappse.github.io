    <div class="meta">
      App: <strong>ScamCheck</strong><br />
      Effective date: <strong><!-- TODO: set date, e.g. 2026-01-14 -->YYYY-MM-DD</strong><br />
      Contact: <a href="mailto:<!-- TODO: privacy email -->privacy@example.com">privacy@example.com</a>

  <main>
    <div class="card note">
      This Privacy Policy explains how ScamCheck (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use
      the ScamCheck mobile application (the “App”). If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not use the App.
    </div>

    <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      Data controller (or equivalent term in your jurisdiction): <strong><!-- TODO: company / developer name -->[Developer Name]</strong><br />
      Address (optional): <strong><!-- TODO: address -->[Address]</strong><br />
      Email: <a href="mailto:<!-- TODO: privacy email -->privacy@example.com">privacy@example.com</a>
    </p>

    <h2>2) What the App does</h2>
    <p>
      ScamCheck helps you assess whether a message, link, or content may be a scam by analyzing text you provide.
      Depending on the App settings and features you use, analysis may be performed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>On-device</strong> (locally, without sending content off your phone), and/or</li>
      <li><strong>Using a cloud-based AI analysis</strong> (content is sent to our server for processing and a result is returned).</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="card note">
      <strong>Important:</strong> The exact data flows depend on your configuration and features enabled.
      This Policy describes common cases and the categories of data involved.
    </div>

    <h2>3) Information we collect</h2>

    <h3>A) Content you submit for analysis</h3>
    <p>
      When you paste or type text (or otherwise provide content) for analysis, the App processes that content to produce a result.
      Depending on the mode you use:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local analysis:</strong> the content stays on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Cloud AI analysis (optional):</strong> the content you submit is transmitted to our servers to generate an analysis.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      We recommend you avoid submitting sensitive personal information (for example, passwords, full bank card numbers, or medical data).
    </p>

    <h3>B) Usage data (limited)</h3>
    <p>
      We may collect basic diagnostic and performance information to keep the App stable and improve it, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>App version and device model</li>
      <li>Operating system version</li>
      <li>Crash logs and error reports</li>
      <li>Approximate timestamps of actions (for troubleshooting)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      <!-- TODO: confirm whether you use analytics SDKs -->
      If you do not use analytics or crash reporting SDKs, remove this section or adjust accordingly.
    </p>

    <h3>C) Purchases and subscription status</h3>
    <p>
      If the App offers paid features (for example, a subscription), purchases are processed by the relevant app store
      (Google Play / Apple App Store). We do not receive your full payment details (such as your full card number).
      We may receive information needed to confirm your entitlement, such as subscription status and product identifiers.
    </p>

    <h3>D) Advertising (only if the App shows ads)</h3>
    <p>
      <!-- TODO: keep or remove depending on your app -->
      If the App displays advertisements, ad partners may collect information such as advertising identifiers, approximate location,
      and interaction data to serve and measure ads. Please see the “Third parties” section below.
      If the App does not show ads, remove this section.
    </p>

    <h2>4) How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide the App features (including generating scam analysis results)</li>
      <li>To maintain, debug, and improve the App</li>
      <li>To prevent abuse, fraud, and security incidents</li>
      <li>To manage subscriptions and access to paid features</li>
      <li><!-- TODO: if ads -->To display and measure ads (if applicable)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Legal bases (EEA, UK, and similar jurisdictions)</h2>
    <p>
      Where applicable, we process personal data under the following legal bases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> (to provide the App features you request)</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (to maintain security, prevent abuse, and improve reliability)</li>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong> (for optional features that require it, such as certain analytics or personalized ads, where applicable)</li>
      <li><strong>Legal obligations</strong> (if we must comply with applicable laws)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) Sharing and disclosure</h2>
    <p>We may share information in the following cases:</p>

    <h3>A) Service providers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cloud processing providers</strong> that host our backend (only for cloud AI analysis mode).</li>
      <li><strong>AI model providers</strong> that process the content to generate an analysis (only for cloud AI analysis mode).</li>
      <li><strong>Crash reporting / diagnostics providers</strong> (only if you use them).</li>
      <li><strong>Ad networks</strong> (only if the App shows ads).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B) Legal reasons</h3>
    <p>
      We may disclose information if required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to protect the rights,
      safety, and security of users, the public, or our services.
    </p>

    <h3>C) Business transfers</h3>
    <p>
      If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, information may be
      transferred as part of that transaction, subject to applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      We keep information only for as long as necessary to provide the App and for the purposes described in this Policy.
      Retention depends on the type of data:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Content submitted for analysis:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Local analysis:</strong> stays on your device unless you choose to save it.</li>
          <li><strong>Cloud AI analysis:</strong> we aim to retain content only as long as needed to provide the result and secure the service.
            <!-- TODO: specify exact retention if you have it, e.g. "not stored" or "stored for X days for abuse prevention" -->
            <em><!-- TODO -->[Specify retention period or “not stored” policy]</em>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> retained for a limited period to troubleshoot and improve reliability.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscription entitlement data:</strong> retained as needed to manage access and comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8) Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information. However, no method of
      transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>9) International transfers</h2>
    <p>
      If you use cloud AI analysis or third-party services, your information may be processed in countries other than your own.
      When required, we use appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers (for example, standard contractual clauses).
    </p>

    <h2>10) Your rights and choices</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on where you live, you may have rights such as access, correction, deletion, portability, and objection or restriction
      of processing. You can contact us at
      <a href="mailto:<!-- TODO: privacy email -->privacy@example.com">privacy@example.com</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Opting out of cloud analysis:</strong> If the App provides a local-only mode, you can use it to keep content on-device.</li>
      <li><strong>Deleting local history:</strong> If the App stores analysis history locally, you can delete it from within the App
        (or by uninstalling the App).</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising choices:</strong> If ads are shown, your device may provide controls for ad personalization
        (for example, limiting the advertising identifier).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11) Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the age defined by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal
      information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us so we can take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>12) Third-party services</h2>
    <p>
      The App may use third-party services (such as app stores, hosting providers, AI providers, crash reporting, analytics, or ad networks).
      Their processing is governed by their own privacy policies.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      <!-- TODO: list your actual providers to be transparent -->
      Recommended: list them explicitly, for example:
      Google Play Billing, Apple App Store, your hosting provider, your AI provider, crash reporting provider, ad network.
    </p>

    <h2>13) Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version here and update the effective date.
      If changes are significant, we may provide additional notice within the App.
